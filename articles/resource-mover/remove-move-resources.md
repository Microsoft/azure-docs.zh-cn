# <a name="manage-move-collections-and-resource-groups"></a>管理移动集合和资源组

本文介绍如何使用 [Azure 资源转移器](overview.md)移动集合中删除资源，或删除移动集合/资源组。 在 Azure 区域之间移动 Azure 资源时会使用移动集合。

## <a name="remove-a-resource-portal"></a>删除资源（门户）

可以从资源转移器门户删除移动集合中的资源，如下所示：

1. 在“跨区域”中，选择想要从集合中删除的所有资源，然后选择“删除” 。 

    ![用于选择删除的按钮](./media/remove-move-resources/portal-select-resources.png)

2. 在“删除资源”中，单击“删除” 。

    ![用于选择从移动集合中删除资源的按钮](./media/remove-move-resources/remove-portal.png)

## <a name="remove-a-move-collectionresource-group-portal"></a>删除移动集合/资源组（门户）

可以在门户中删除移动集合/资源组。

1. 按照上述过程中的说明从集合中删除资源。 在删除资源组时，请确保它不包含任何资源。
2. 删除移动集合或资源组。  

## <a name="remove-a-resource-powershell"></a>删除资源 (PowerShell)

使用 PowerShell cmdlet，可以从 MoveCollection 中删除单个资源，也可以删除多个资源。

### <a name="remove-a-single-resource"></a>删除单个资源

删除单个资源（在本示例中为虚拟网络 psdemorm-vnet），如下所示：

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Remove a resource using the resource ID
Remove-AzResourceMoverMoveResource -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS" -Name "psdemorm-vnet"
```
**运行 cmdlet 后的输出**

![从移动集合中删除资源后的输出文本](./media/remove-move-resources/powershell-remove-single-resource.png)

### <a name="remove-multiple-resources"></a>删除多个资源

删除多个资源，如下所示：

1. 验证依赖项：

    ````azurepowershell-interactive
    $resp = Invoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"  -MoveResource $('psdemorm-vnet') -ValidateOnly
    ```

    **Output after running cmdlet**

    ![Output text after removing multiple resources from a move collection](./media/remove-move-resources/remove-multiple-validate-dependencies.png)

2. Retrieve the dependent resources that need to be removed (along with our example virtual network psdemorm-vnet):

    ````azurepowershell-interactive
    $resp.AdditionalInfo[0].InfoMoveResource
    ```

    **Output after running cmdlet**

    ![Output text after removing multiple resources from a move collection](./media/remove-move-resources/remove-multiple-get-dependencies.png)


3. Remove all resources, along with the virtual network:

    
    ````azurepowershell-interactive
    Invoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"  -MoveResource $('PSDemoVM','psdemovm111', 'PSDemoRM-vnet','PSDemoVM-nsg')
    ```

    **Output after running cmdlet**

    ![Output text after removing all resources from a move collection](./media/remove-move-resources/remove-multiple-all.png)


## Remove a collection (PowerShell)

Remove an entire move collection from the subscription, as follows:

1. Follow the instructions above to remove resources in the collection using PowerShell.
2. Run:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Remove-AzResourceMoverMoveCollection -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"
    ```

    **Output after running cmdlet**

## VM resource state after removing

What happens when you remove a VM resource from a move collection depends on the resource state, as summarized in the table.

###  Remove VM state
**Resource state** | **VM** | **Networking**
--- | --- | --- 
**Added to move collection** | Delete from move collection. | Delete from move collection. 
**Dependencies resolved/prepare pending** | Delete from move collection  | Delete from move collection. 
**Prepare in progress**<br/> (or any other state in progress) | Delete operation fails with error.  | Delete operation fails with error.
**Prepare failed** | Delete from the move collection.<br/>Delete anything created in the target region, including replica disks. <br/><br/> Infrastructure resources created during the move need to be deleted manually. | Delete from the move collection.  
**Initiate move pending** | Delete from move collection.<br/><br/> Delete anything created in the target region, including VM, replica disks etc.  <br/><br/> Infrastructure resources created during the move need to be deleted manually. | Delete from move collection.
**Initiate move failed** | Delete from move collection.<br/><br/> Delete anything created in the target region, including VM, replica disks etc.  <br/><br/> Infrastructure resources created during the move need to be deleted manually. | Delete from move collection.
**Commit pending** | We recommend that you discard the move so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there. | We recommend that you discard the move so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there. 
**Commit failed** | We recommend that you discard the  so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there. | We recommend that you discard the move so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there.
**Discard completed** | The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state.<br/><br/> It's deleted from the move collection, along with anything created at target - VM, replica disks, vault etc.  <br/><br/> Infrastructure resources created during the move need to be deleted manually. <br/><br/> Infrastructure resources created during the move need to be deleted manually. |  The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state.<br/><br/> It's deleted from the move collection.

**Delete source pending** | Deleted from the move collection.<br/><br/> It doesn't delete anything created in the target region.  | Deleted from the move collection.<br/><br/> It doesn't delete anything created in the target region.
**Delete source failed** | Deleted from the move collection.<br/><br/> It doesn't delete anything created in the target region. | Deleted from the move collection.<br/><br/> It doesn't delete anything created in the target region.

## SQL resource state after removing

What happens when you remove an Azure SQL resource from a move collection depends on the resource state, as summarized in the table.

**Resource state** | **SQL** 
--- | --- 
**Added to move collection** | Delete from move collection. 
**Dependencies resolved/prepare pending** | Delete from move collection 
**Prepare in progress**<br/> (or any other state in progress)  | Delete operation fails with error. 
**Prepare failed** | Delete from move collection<br/><br/>Delete anything created in the target region. 
**Initiate move pending** |  Delete from move collection<br/><br/>Delete anything created in the target region. The SQL database exists at this point and will be deleted. 
**Initiate move failed** | Delete from move collection<br/><br/>Delete anything created in the target region. The SQL database exists at this point and must be deleted. 
**Commit pending** | We recommend that you discard the move so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there.
**Commit failed** | We recommend that you discard the move so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there. 
**Discard completed** |  The resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state.<br/><br/> It's deleted from the move collection, along with anything created at target, including SQL databases. 
**Discard failed** | We recommend that you discard the moves so that the target resources are deleted first.<br/><br/> After that, the resource goes back to the **Initiate move pending** state, and you can continue from there. 
**Delete source pending** | Deleted from the move collection.<br/><br/> It doesn't delete anything created in the target region. 
**Delete source failed** | Deleted from the move collection.<br/><br/> It doesn't delete anything created in the target region.
